# Web Performance Runner

Web Performance Runner is a utility to perform web performance testing on any web page. It uses web performance services (currently only [webpagetest.org](http://webpagetest.org/)) to run your configured tests. This utility then downloads the results and generates reports, allowing you to see how your web pages are performing over time to detect degrading performance or to learn how to optimize your performance at any point. Tests can be configured to run through contentious integration, such as Jenkins, and reports can be emailed automatically with a synopsis.
